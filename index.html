        <p> Attempting to cross the southern border of the United States, migrants and refugees face a road full of violence and treachery. With the ongoing threats of climate change, political instability, and economic uncertainty triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, incidences of targeted violence will only continue to increase. Yet, these events remain undereported as migration status makes individuals vulnerable to threats of deportaton and criminalization. Thus, <i>Justicia Migratoria</i> seeks to develop a tool for community members to <strong>(1) </strong> <span style="color:darkviolet ">document incidents of violence experienced in the migration trail</span>, <strong>(2) </strong> <span style="color: Tomato">uplift migrants’ stories on their own terms</span>, and <strong>(3) </strong> <span style="color:darkgreen">bring visibility to the gap between documented/undocumented reports of violence against migrants</span>.</p> 
        <p>If you are a migrant and a survivor of any form of violence at the United States border, we invite you to report your experience through our online survey. Legal advocates are also welcome to take our survey to report on behalf of migrant survivors. All survey responses will remain anonymous and will not be reported to any authorities. </p>
